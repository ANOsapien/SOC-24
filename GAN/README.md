# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for MNIST

This code contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. The GAN is designed to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The project uses a simple architecture for both the Generator and Discriminator models.

## Overview

### Models
- **Generator:** 
  - Takes a noise vector as input and generates an image that aims to resemble the MNIST digits.
  - Architecture:
    - Linear Layer -> LeakyReLU -> Linear Layer -> Tanh Activation

- **Discriminator:** 
  - Takes an image as input and outputs a probability indicating whether the image is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator).
  - Architecture:
    - Linear Layer -> LeakyReLU -> Linear Layer -> Sigmoid Activation

### Training
- **Discriminator Training:**
  - Maximizes the probability of correctly classifying real and fake images.
  - Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)

- **Generator Training:**
  - Aims to fool the Discriminator by generating images that the Discriminator classifies as real.
  - Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)

### TensorBoard
- TensorBoard is used to visualize the generated images and track the training progress.
- Logs are saved in the `logs` directory, with separate subdirectories for fake and real images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- TensorBoard

You can install the necessary packages using pip:
