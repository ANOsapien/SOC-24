# U-Net

This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation. The U-Net model is widely used for biomedical image segmentation but can be applied to various segmentation tasks.

## Overview

U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for fast and precise image segmentation. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.
